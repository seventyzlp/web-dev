I am an avid video game enthusiast with prior experience in game development and design.

I am highly interested in game design theory and regularly watch GDC lectures to improve my knowledge.

I have programming experience and can implement simple system architectures as needed. Additionally, I possess knowledge of Linux, maintain my own server, and have set up a WordPress-based blog server.

I am proficient in using game engines such as Unreal and Unity for complex tasks and can write plugins as required. This enables me to quickly prototype games.
